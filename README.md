# random-question

Moodle mod that allows the random distribution of a set of questions to the students of a course. 

The themes or questions can be set in the edit area of the instance activity. 

Full pool of random themes/questions must be placed in the **Optional random quesitons** field.

If, perhaps, your pool of themes/questions is bigger than the number of students and there are some themes/questions that you want to make sure are given away to the students you must take them from the previous *Optional random quesitons* field and put them into the **Mandatory random questions** field.

The teacher can see the distributed questions and answers so far. 

No grade system is implemented since the mod was first thought to be used in an open debate kinda activity in the class.
